    <h2>Make a delicious corn cake using a blender</h2>
        <p>The corn cake is one of the most traditional delicacies served during the Junine festivities, and it is also considered one of the iconic dishes from Northeast of Brazil. Here we will use canned corn and corn flakes, but you can use corn cobs grated instead.</p>
        <p>That is one of the main reasons I selected this dish, and you will be impressed how easy and fast is to make it. This corn cake is humid, fluffy, delicious, and it is perfect for your breakfast, afternoon tea, or for a picnic.</p>
